## Colour changer   

using code from earlier vanilla js colour changer.  
reusing same math.random function.   
using state - and using componentDidMount() and componentDidUpdate() - not the best solution, it causes extra rendering - can see in console.  
unable to get "hex" to show as a string - will try later.
