## Colour changer   

Using code from earlier vanilla js colour changer.  
Reusing same math.random function.   
Using function and hooks to fix problem from state using componentDidMount() and componentDidUpdate() (it caused extra rendering - could see in console.
and "hex" now shows as a string).
